## :scroll: Description: 

Do you find yourself spending too much time formatting README files? Same here! Luckily, this README Generator was designed to help eliminate some of those tedious steps. This very README that you are reading was created with this simple app! 


## :man_mechanic: Installation:

To install this app, you must clone the repo into a local file in your machine. You must have Node.js installed in order for this application to work (current version, not most recent).


## :book: Usage Info:

To use this app, navigate into the folder that you cloned the repo into using your Terminal. (You can do this using an app like GitBash or directly inside of your code editor) Next, use the command 'node index' to initialize the set questions for you to answer. Complete all of the questions and when you are finished, a README.md file will be created inside your folder! You can edit your README that was created, or start the 'node index' command all over again to start fresh! (Your new answers are saved in the same README that was previously created.
